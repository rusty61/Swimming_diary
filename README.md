# Welcome to swimming Diary app

## Public assets

The `public` directory ships static assets that are bundled with the app:

- `favicon.ico`: The app's favicon, displayed in browser tabs and bookmarks to identify the Swimming Diary.
- `placeholder.svg`: A simple SVG placeholder used wherever an image slot needs a neutral graphic before real photos are available.
- `robots.txt`: Standard directives that inform crawlers how to index or respect the site when it is deployed.

## Replacing the favicon

1. Generate a new `favicon.ico` file (commonly a 32x32 or 48x48 ICO exported from your design tool).
2. Place the new file in `public/favicon.ico`, replacing the existing one.
3. Restart the dev server (if it is running) and refresh your browser cache to see the updated tab icon.
